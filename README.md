# SOC Threat Detection & Response Lab
This repository contains the findings and results of a Security Operations Center (SOC) threat detection and response project designed to simulate real-world incident detection and response workflows. The project involved the configuration of Splunk for log monitoring, the creation of dashboards for data visualization, and the automation of incident response workflows using Ansible.

### Project Overview                                                            
Target: SOC environment for monitoring and analyzing security data
Tools Used: Splunk, Ansible                                                            

===========================================================================

## Objectives:
  • Configure and deploy a SOC environment using Splunk for real-time data monitoring and threat detection.
  • Create and configure dashboards in Splunk to visualize security-related events.
  • Set up automated alerts in Splunk for quick detection of potential incidents.
  • Automate security incident response workflows with Ansible to improve efficiency in handling alerts.

## Key Achievements:
  • Successfully deployed a SOC environment with Splunk for real-time monitoring of security data.
  • Created 3 dashboards to visualize real-time security data and enhance incident detection.
  • Configured 5 automated alerts in Splunk to detect and respond to potential security incidents, improving monitoring          efficiency.
  • Automated the configuration of two critical system components using Ansible, reducing the manual intervention required       for incident response.
  • Streamlined the threat detection and response process by integrating Splunk with Ansible for automated actions.

## Skills Developed:
  • SOC environment configuration and management using Splunk.
  • Real-time threat monitoring and incident detection through the creation of dashboards and automated alerts.
  • Automation of incident response workflows using Ansible to reduce response time and enhance efficiency.
  • Data visualization in Splunk to present security metrics and trends clearly.
  • Integration of automation tools (Splunk + Ansible) to improve response times in a security operations setting.

## Recommendations for Improving Threat Detection & Response:
  • Regularly update dashboards and alerts to adapt to new security threats and vulnerabilities.
  • Automate more aspects of incident response to minimize human intervention and speed up the response time.
  • Integrate threat intelligence feeds into Splunk for enhanced detection of emerging threats.
  • Test incident response workflows regularly to ensure preparedness and efficiency in a live environment.
